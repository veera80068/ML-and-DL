    "Human Intelligence has always been fascinating for scientist. Understanding how brain works can answer a lot of important questions. Because of a lot of research in the area of neuro science, there is a vague understanding on how the brain works. We know that there is something called as **BIOLOGICAL NEURON** which acts as abasic building block. \n",
